This repository provides the code and data necessary to fully reproduce the stability analysis in Fig. 3 and the coupled conceptual models in Fig. B2 of the paper "Destabilization of Earth system tipping elements."
The included code computes the restoring rate (Î») for four climate tipping elements:

1. **Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS)**
2. **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)**
3. **Amazon Rainforest**
4. **South American Monsoon System (SAMS)**

Each system was analyzed using consistent methodology across observation-based records, allowing for robust cross-element comparison of resilience loss.
